# Tipsy App
## Overview
The Tipsy app is a handy tool for calculating the total amount to be paid by a group of people for a service, including the option to add tips. With a user-friendly interface and efficient features, the app utilizes UIKit, a stepper control, Storyboard, and follows the MVC design pattern. It also incorporates Segue and data parsing to seamlessly transition between screens and provide a breakdown of the amount each person should contribute.

## Features
Bill Splitting: Enter the total amount, select the tip percentage (0%, 10%, or 20%), and specify the number of people. The app calculates the total amount to be paid by each person, considering the selected tip percentage.
Stepper Control: Use the stepper control to easily adjust the number of people sharing the bill.
Seamless UI: The app features an intuitive and visually appealing UI designed with UIKit and Storyboard for a smooth user experience.
Breakdown Screen: After tapping the "Calculate" button, the app seamlessly transitions to a screen providing a detailed breakdown of the amount to be paid by each person.
